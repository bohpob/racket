## Higher-Order Functions in Racket
Implementations of the following higher-order functions in Racket:

`foldr` — Fold Right applies a two-argument function to each element in a list from
right to left, starting with a base value

`foldl` — Fold Left applies a two-argument function to each element in a list from left
to right, starting with a base value

`foldtree` — Fold Tree applies a two-argument function to each element in a tree

`map` — The map function traverses a list and applies a given function to every value in
the list

`reduce` — Reduce uses a binary operation to combine the elements of a sequence

`filter` — Returns a list of items in the given list for which the specified predicate
returns a non-#f value

`atom` — Returns false if it is a list or pair; otherwise returns true

`length-list` — Returns the length of a list

`bubble-sort` — Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the
list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This
process repeats until the list is sorted

`insertion-sort` — Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted
list one item at a time

## Example Usage

Each function is accompanied by tests, which can be viewed in the project itself.
